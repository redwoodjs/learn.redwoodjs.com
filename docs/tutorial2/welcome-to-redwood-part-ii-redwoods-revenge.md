Part 1 of the tutorial was a huge success! It introduced billions (maybe an exaggeration) of developers to what Redwood could do to make web development in the Javascript ecosystem a delight. But that was just the beginning.

If you read the README [closely](https://github.com/redwoodjs/redwood#technologies) you may have seen a few technologies that we didn't touch on at all in the first tutorial: [Storybook](https://storybook.js.org/) and [Jest](https://jestjs.io/) to name a couple. In reality, these have been core to the very idea of Redwood from the beginningâ€”an improvement to the entire experience of developing a web application.

While they're totally optional, we believe using these two tools will greatly improve your development experience, making your applications easier to develop, easier to maintain, and easier to share with a larger team. In this second tutorial we're going to show you how.

Oh, and while we're at it we'll introduce Role-based Access Control (RBAC), which wasn't available when we wrote the first tutorial, but is now, and it's amazing.

Why "Redwood's Revenge"? Because all great sequels have "Revenge" in their title. But also this tutorial is focused more on ourselves, the codebase in general, and making our jobs easier. Part 1 of the tutorial was about getting up and running quickly and getting an app out the door for users to start using. Part 2 is about helping us, the developers, build new features quicker and making sure the code we wrote keeps working as intended. And as the old saying goes: the best revenge is living well.

> Part 1 of the tutorial was built against the latest release candidate of v1.0 of RedwoodJS. Part 2 is in the midst of being updated to match, so you may see subtle differences if you pick up where Part 1 left off.
