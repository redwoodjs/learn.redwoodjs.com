Our amazing blog posts will obviously garner a huge and passionate fanbase and we will very rarely have only a single comment. Let's work on displaying a list of comments.

Let's think about where our comments are being displayed. Probably not on the homepage, since that only shows a summary of each post. A user would need to go to the full page to show the comments for that blog post. But that page is only fetching the data for the single blog post itself, nothing else. We'll need to get the comments and since we'll be fetching *and* displaying them, that sounds like a job for a Cell.

> **Couldn't the query for the blog post page also fetch the comments?**
>
> Yes, it could! But the idea behind Cells is to make components even more [composable](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Composability) by having them be responsible for their own data fetching *and* display. If we rely on a blog post to fetch the comments then the new Comments component we're about to create now requires something *else* to fetch the comments and pass them in. If we re-use the Comments component somewhere, now we're fetching comments in two different places.

> **But what about the Comment component we just made, why doesn't that fetch its own data?**

> There aren't any instances I (the author) could think of where we would ever want to display only a single comment in isolation—it would always be a list of all comments on a post. If displaying a single comment was common for your use case then it could definitely be converted to a **CommentCell** and have it responsible for pulling the data for that single comment itself. But keep in mind that if you have 50 comments on a blog post, that's now 50 GraphQL calls that need to go out, one for each comment. There's always a trade-off!
>
> **Then why make a standalone Comment component at all? Why not just do all the display in the CommentsCell?**
>
> We're trying to start in small chunks to make the tutorial more digestible for a new audience so we're starting simple and getting more complex as we go. But it also just feels *nice* to build up a UI from these smaller chunks that are easier to reason about and keep separate in your head.

### Storybook

Let's generate a **CommentsCell**:

```bash
yarn rw g cell Comments
```

Storybook updates with a new **CommentsCell** under the **Cells** folder. Let's update the Success story to use the Comment component created earlier, and return all of the fields we'll need for the **Comment** to render:

```javascript {3,9-11,24}
// web/src/components/CommentsCell/CommentsCell.js

import Comment from 'src/components/Comment'

export const QUERY = gql`
  query CommentsQuery {
    comments {
      id
      name
      body
      createdAt
    }
  }
`

export const Loading = () => <div>Loading...</div>

export const Empty = () => <div>Empty</div>

export const Failure = ({ error }) => <div>Error: {error.message}</div>

export const Success = ({ comments }) => {
  return comments.map((comment) => (
    <Comment key={comment.id} comment={comment} />
  ))
}
```

We're passing an additional `key` prop to make React happy when iterating over an array with `map`.

If you check Storybook, you'll seen an error. We'll need to update the `mock.js` file that came along for the ride when we generated the Cell so that it returns an array instead of just a simple object with some sample data:

```javascript {4-17}
// web/src/components/CommentsCell/CommentsCell.mock.js

export const standard = (/* vars, { ctx, req } */) => ({
  comments: [
    {
      id: 1,
      name: 'Rob Cameron',
      body: 'First comment',
      createdAt: '2020-01-02T12:34:56Z',
    },
    {
      id: 2,
      name: 'David Price',
      body: 'Second comment',
      createdAt: '2020-02-03T23:00:00Z',
    },
  ],
})
```

> What's this `standard` thing? Think of it as the standard, default mock if you don't do anything else. We would have loved to use the name "default" but that's already a reserved word in Javascript!

Storybook refreshes and we've got comments! We've got the same issue here where it's hard to see our rounded corners and also the two separate comments are hard to distinguish because they're right next to each other:

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/300/95799544-dce60300-0ca9-11eb-9520-a1aac4ec46e6.png)

The gap between the two comments *is* a concern for this component, since it's responsible for drawing multiple comments and their layout. So let's fix that in **CommentsCell**:

```javascript {5,10}
// web/src/components/CommentsCell/CommentsCell.js

export const Success = ({ comments }) => {
  return (
    <div className="space-y">

      {comments.map((comment) => (
        <Comment key={comment.id} comment={comment} />
      ))}
    </div>  )
}
```

Again, instead of adding margins to the Comment component itself we work with the parent component: in this case we're telling it to add a space between elements. Remember: each component should be responsible for its own display.

Let's add a margin around the story itself, similar to what we did in the Comment story:

```javascript {5}
// web/src/components/CommentsCell/CommentsCell.stories.js

export const success = () => {
  return Success ? (
    <div className="m-4">

      <Success {...standard()} />
    </div>  ) : null
}
```

> Because we've been careful about styling our CommentsCell component we can always add margins around it without incurring into [margin collapsing](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Box_Model/Mastering_margin_collapsing). That's one less thing we need to worry about!

Looking good! Let's add our CommentsCell to the actual blog post display page:

```javascript {4,21}
// web/src/components/BlogPost/BlogPost.js

import { Link, routes } from '@redwoodjs/router'
import CommentsCell from 'src/components/CommentsCell'

const truncate = (text, length) => {
  return text.substring(0, length) + '...'
}

const BlogPost = ({ post, summary = false }) => {
  return (
    <article className="mt-10">
      <header>
        <h2 className="text-xl text-blue-700 font-semibold">
          <Link to={routes.blogPost({ id: post.id })}>{post.title}</Link>
        </h2>
      </header>
      <div className="mt-2 text-gray-900 font-light">
        {summary ? truncate(post.body, 100) : post.body}
      </div>
      {!summary && <CommentsCell />}
    </article>
  )
}

export default BlogPost
```

If we are *not* showing the summary, then we'll show the comments. Take a look at the **Full** and **Summary** stories and you should see comments on one and not on the other.

> **Shouldn't the CommentsCell cause an actual GraphQL request? How does this work?**
>
> Redwood has added some functionality around Storybook so if you're testing a component that itself isn't a Cell (like **BlogPost**) but that renders a cell (**CommentsCell**) that it needs to mock the GraphQL and use the `standard` mock that goes along with that Cell. Pretty cool, huh?

Once again our component is bumping right up against the edges of the window. We've got two stories in this file and would have to manually add margins around both of them. Ugh. Luckily Storybook has a way to add styling to all stories using [decorators](https://storybook.js.org/docs/react/writing-stories/decorators). In the `default` export at the bottom of the story you can define a `decorators` key and the value is JSX that will wrap all the stories in the file automatically:

```javascript {5-7}
// web/src/components/BlogPost/BlogPost.stories.js

export default {
  title: 'Components/BlogPost',
  decorators: [
    (Story) => <div className="m-8"><Story /></div>
  ]
}
```

Save, and both the **Full** and **Summary** stories should have margins around them now.

> For more extensive, global styling options, look into Storybook [theming](https://storybook.js.org/docs/react/configure/theming).

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/300/96509066-5d5bb500-1210-11eb-8ddd-8786b7033cac.png)

We could use a gap between the end of the blog post and the start of the comments to help separate the two:

```javascript {15-17}
// web/src/components/BlogPost/BlogPost.js

const BlogPost = ({ post, summary = false }) => {
  return (
    <article className="mt-10">
      <header>
        <h2 className="text-xl text-blue-700 font-semibold">
          <Link to={routes.blogPost({ id: post.id })}>{post.title}</Link>
        </h2>
      </header>
      <div className="mt-2 text-gray-900 font-light">
        {summary ? truncate(post.body, 100) : post.body}
      </div>
      {!summary && (
        <div className="mt-24">
          <CommentsCell />
        </div>
      )}
    </article>
  )
}
```

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/300/100682809-bfd5c400-332b-11eb-98e0-d2d526c1aa58.png)

Okay, comment display is looking good! However, you may have noticed that if you tried going to the actual site there's an error where the comments should be:

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/300/101549636-e1096680-3962-11eb-83fe-930d4bc631df.png)

Why is that? Remember that we started with the `CommentsCell`, but never actually created a Comment model in `schema.prisma` or created an SDL and service! That's another neat part of working with Storybook: you can build out UI functionality completely isolated from the api-side. In a team setting this is great because a web-side team can work on the UI while the api-side team can be building the backend end simultaneously and one doesn't have to wait for the other.

### Testing

We added one component, **Comments**, and edited another, **BlogPost**, so we'll want to add tests in both.

#### Testing Comments

The actual **Comment** component does most of the work so there's no need to test all of that functionality again. What things does **CommentsCell** do that make it unique?

* Has a loading message
* Has an error message
* Has a failure message
* When it renders successfully, it outputs as many comments as were returned by the `QUERY`

The default `CommentsCell.test.js` actually tests every state for us, albeit at an absolute minimum level—it make sure no errors are thrown:

```javascript
import { render, screen } from '@redwoodjs/testing'
import { Loading, Empty, Failure, Success } from './CommentsCell'
import { standard } from './CommentsCell.mock'

describe('CommentsCell', () => {
  test('Loading renders successfully', () => {
    expect(() => {
      render(<Loading />)
    }).not.toThrow()
  })

  test('Empty renders successfully', async () => {
    expect(() => {
      render(<Empty />)
    }).not.toThrow()
  })

  test('Failure renders successfully', async () => {
    expect(() => {
      render(<Failure error={new Error('Oh no')} />)
    }).not.toThrow()
  })

  test('Success renders successfully', async () => {
    expect(() => {
      render(<Success comments={standard().comments} />)
    }).not.toThrow()
  })
})
```

And that's nothing to scoff at! As you've probably experienced, a React component usually either works 100% or throws an error. If it works, great! If it fails then the test fails too, which is exactly what we want to happen.

But in this case we can do a little more to make sure **CommentsCell** is doing what we expect. Let's update the `Success` test in `CommentsCell.test.js` to check that exactly the number of comments we passed in as a prop are rendered. How do we know a comment was rendered? How about if we check that each `comment.body` (the most important part of the comment) is present on the screen:

```javascript {4-9}
// web/src/components/CommentsCell/CommentsCell.test.js

test('Success renders successfully', async () => {
  const comments = standard().comments
  render(<Success comments={comments} />)

  comments.forEach((comment) => {
    expect(screen.getByText(comment.body)).toBeInTheDocument()
  })
})
```

We're looping through each `comment` from the mock, the same mock used by Storybook, so that even if we add more later, we're covered.

#### Testing BlogPost

The functionality we added to `<BlogPost>` says to show the comments for the post if we are *not* showing the summary. We've got a test for both the "full" and "summary" renders already. Generally you want your tests to be testing "one thing" so let's add two additional tests for our new functionality:

```javascript {3,5,22-30,42-50}
// web/src/components/BlogPost/BlogPost.test.js

import { render, screen, waitFor } from '@redwoodjs/testing'
import BlogPost from './BlogPost'
import { standard } from 'src/components/CommentsCell/CommentsCell.mock'

const POST = {
  id: 1,
  title: 'First post',
  body: `Neutra tacos hot chicken prism raw denim, put a bird on it enamel pin post-ironic vape cred DIY. Street art next level umami squid. Hammock hexagon glossier 8-bit banjo. Neutra la croix mixtape echo park four loko semiotics kitsch forage chambray. Semiotics salvia selfies jianbing hella shaman. Letterpress helvetica vaporware cronut, shaman butcher YOLO poke fixie hoodie gentrify woke heirloom.`,
  createdAt: new Date().toISOString(),
}

describe('BlogPost', () => {
  it('renders a blog post', () => {
    render(<BlogPost post={POST} />)

    expect(screen.getByText(POST.title)).toBeInTheDocument()
    expect(screen.getByText(POST.body)).toBeInTheDocument()
  })

  it('renders comments when displaying a full blog post', async () => {
    const comment = standard().comments[0]
    render(<BlogPost post={POST} />)

    await waitFor(() =>
      expect(screen.getByText(comment.body)).toBeInTheDocument()
    )
  })

  it('renders a summary of a blog post', () => {
    render(<BlogPost post={POST} summary={true} />)

    expect(screen.getByText(POST.title)).toBeInTheDocument()
    expect(
      screen.getByText(
        'Neutra tacos hot chicken prism raw denim, put a bird on it enamel pin post-ironic vape cred DIY. Str...'
      )
    ).toBeInTheDocument()
  })

  it('does not render comments when displaying a summary', async () => {
    const comment = standard().comments[0]
    render(<BlogPost post={POST} summary={true} />)

    await waitFor(() =>
      expect(screen.queryByText(comment.body)).not.toBeInTheDocument()
    )
  })
})
```

We're introducing a new test function here, `waitFor()`, which will wait for things like GraphQL queries to finish running before checking for what's been rendered. Since **BlogPost** renders **CommentsCell** we need to wait for the `Success` component of **CommentsCell** to be rendered.

> The summary version of **BlogPost** does *not* render the **CommentsCell**, but we should still wait. Why? If we did mistakenly start including **CommentsCell**, but didn't wait for the render, we would get a falsely passing test—indeed the text isn't on the page but that's because it's still showing the **Loading** component! If we had waited we would have seen the actual comment body get rendered, and the test would (correctly) fail.

Okay we're finally ready to let users create their comments.
