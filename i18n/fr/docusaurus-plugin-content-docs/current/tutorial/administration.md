Having the admin screens at `/admin` is a reasonable thing to do. Let's update the routes to make that happen by updating the four routes starting with `/posts` to start with `/admin/posts` instead:

```html
// web/src/Routes.js

<Route path="/admin/posts/new" page="{NewPostPage}" name="newPost" />
<Route path="/admin/posts/{id:Int}/edit" page="{EditPostPage}" name="editPost" />
<Route path="/admin/posts/{id:Int}" page="{PostPage}" name="post" />
<Route path="/admin/posts" page="{PostsPage}" name="posts" />
```

Head to http://localhost:8910/admin/posts and our generated scaffold page should come up. Thanks to named routes we don't have to update any of the `<Link>`s that were generated by the scaffolds since the `name`s of the pages didn't change!

> **What about authentication?**
> 
> On the last page we said we were going to set up an admin section **and** put it behind a login. So far, all we've done is updated the routes. Don't worry, we haven't forgotten! We will be setting up authentication in a [future step](./authentication).

How about getting this thing out into the real world?
