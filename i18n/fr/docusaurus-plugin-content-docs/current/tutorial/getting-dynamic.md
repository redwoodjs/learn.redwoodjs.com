These two pages are great and all but where are the actual blog posts in this blog? Let's work on those next.

For the purposes of our tutorial we're going to get our blog posts from a database. Because relational databases are still the workhorses of many complex (and not-so-complex) web applications, we've made SQL access a first-class citizen. For Redwood apps, it all starts with the schema.

### Creating the Database Schema

We need to decide what data we'll need for a blog post. We'll expand on this at some point, but at a minimum we'll want to start with:

- `id` the unique identifier for this blog post (all of our database tables will have one of these)
- `title`
- `body` the actual content of the blog post
- `createdAt` a timestamp of when this record was created

We use [Prisma Client JS](https://github.com/prisma/prisma-client-js) to talk to the database. Prisma has another library called [Migrate](https://github.com/prisma/migrate) that lets us update the database's schema in a predictable way and snapshot each of those changes. Each change is called a _migration_ and Migrate will create one when we make changes to our schema.

First let's define the data structure for a post in the database. Open up `api/db/schema.prisma` and add the definition of our Post table (remove any "sample" models that are present in the file). Once you're done the entire schema file should look like:

```plaintext {13-18}
// api/db/schema.prisma

datasource DS {
  provider = "sqlite"
  url      = env("DATABASE_URL")
}

generator client {
  provider      = "prisma-client-js"
  binaryTargets = "native"
}

model Post {
  id        Int      @id @default(autoincrement())
  title     String
  body      String
  createdAt DateTime @default(now())
}
```

This says that we want a table called `Post` and it should have:

- An `id` column of type `Int`, we let Prisma know this is the column it should use as the `@id` (for it to create relationships to other tables) and that the `@default` value should be Prisma's special `autoincrement()` method letting it know that the DB should set it automatically when new records are created
- A `title` field that will contain a `String`
- A `body` field that will contain a `String`
- A `createdAt` field that will be a `DateTime` and will `@default` to `now()` when we create a new record (so we don't have to set the time manually in our app)

> **Integer vs. String IDs**
> 
> For the tutorial we're keeping things simple and using an integer for our ID column. Some apps may want to use a CUID or a UUID which Prisma supports. In that case you would use `String` for the datatype instead of `Int` and use `cuid()` or `uuid()` instead of `autoincrement()`:
> 
> `id String @id @default(cuid())`
> 
> Integers also make for nicer URLs like https://redwoodblog.com/posts/123 instead of https://redwoodblog.com/posts/eebb026c-b661-42fe-93bf-f1a373421a13.
> 
> Take a look at the [official Prisma documentation](https://www.prisma.io/docs/reference/tools-and-interfaces/prisma-schema/data-model#defining-an-id-field) for more on ID fields.

### Migrations

That was simple. Now we'll want to snapshot this as a migration:

    yarn redwood db save "create posts"

You've named the migration "create posts", and this is for your own benefitâ€”Redwood doesn't care about the migration's name, it's just a reference for future developers.

After the command completes you'll see a new subdirectory created under `api/db/migrations` that has a timestamp and the name you gave the migration. It will contain a couple files inside (a snapshot of what the schema looked like at that point in time in `schema.prisma` and the directives that Prisma Migrate will use to make the change to the database in `steps.json`).

We apply the migration with another command:

    yarn rw db up

> **`redwood` Shorthand**
> 
> From now on we'll use the shorter `rw` alias instead of the full `redwood` name.

This will apply the migration (which runs the commands against the database to create the changes we need) which results in creating a new table called `Post` with the fields we defined above.

### Creating a Post Editor

We haven't decided on the look and feel of our site yet, but wouldn't it be amazing if we could play around with posts without having to build a bunch of pages that we'll probably throw away once the design team gets back to us? Lucky for us, "Amazing" is Redwood's middle name! It has no last name.

Let's generate everything we need to perform all the CRUD (Create, Retrieve, Update, Delete) actions on posts so we can not only verify that we've got the right fields in the database, but let us get some sample posts in there so we can start laying out our pages and see real content. Redwood has a generator for just the occasion:

    yarn rw g scaffold post

Let's point the browser to `http://localhost:8910/posts` and see what we have:

<img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/300/73027952-53c03080-3de9-11ea-8f5b-d62a3676bbef.png" />

Well that's barely more than we got when we generated a page. What happens if we click that "New Post" button?

<img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/300/73028004-72262c00-3de9-11ea-8924-66d1cc1fceb6.png" />

Okay, now we're getting somewhere. Fill in the title and body and click "Save".

<img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/300/73028757-08a71d00-3deb-11ea-8813-046c8479b439.png" />

Did we just create a post in the database? And then show that post here on this page? Yes, yes we did. Try creating another:

<img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/300/73028839-312f1700-3deb-11ea-8e83-0012a3cf689d.png" />

But what if we click "Edit" on one of those posts?

<img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/300/73031307-9802ff00-3df0-11ea-9dc1-ea9af8f21890.png" />

Okay but what if we click "Delete"?

<img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/300/73031339-aea95600-3df0-11ea-9d58-475d9ef43988.png" />

So, Redwood just created all the pages, components and services necessary to perform all CRUD actions on our posts table. No need to open a database GUI or login through a terminal window and write SQL from scratch. Redwood calls these _scaffolds_. Pretty neat, right?

Here's what happened when we ran that `yarn rw g scaffold post` command:

- Added an _SDL_ file to define several GraphQL queries and mutations in `api/src/graphql/posts.sdl.js`
- Added a _services_ file in `api/src/services/posts/posts.js` that makes the Prisma Client JS calls to get data in and out of the database
- Created several _pages_ in `web/src/pages`:
  - `EditPostPage` for editing a post
  - `NewPostPage` for creating a new post
  - `PostPage` for showing the detail of a post
  - `PostsPage` for listing all the posts
- Created routes for those pages in `web/src/Routes.js`
- Created three _cells_ in `web/src/components`:
  - `EditPostCell` gets the post to edit in the database
  - `PostCell` gets the post to display
  - `PostsCell` gets all the posts
- Created four _components_ also in `web/src/components`:
  - `NewPost` displays the form for creating a new post
  - `Post` displays a single post
  - `PostForm` the actual form used by both the New and Edit components
  - `Posts` displays the table of all posts

> **Generator Naming Conventions**
> 
> You'll notice that some of the generated parts have plural names and some have singular. This convention is borrowed from Ruby on Rails which uses a more "human" naming convention: if you're dealing with multiple of something (like the list of all posts) it will be plural. If you're only dealing with a single something (like creating a new post) it will be singular. It sounds natural when speaking, too: "show me a list of all the posts" versus "I'm going to create a new post."
> 
> As far as the generators are concerned:
> 
> - Services filenames are always plural.
> - The methods in the services will be singular or plural depending on if they are expected to return multiple posts or a single post (`posts` vs. `createPost`).
> - SDL filenames are plural.
> - Pages that come with the scaffolds are plural or singular depending on whether they deal with many or one post. When using the `page` generator it will stick with whatever name you give the command.
> - Layouts use the name you give them on the command line.
> - Components and cells, like pages, will be plural or singular depending on context when created by the scaffold generator, otherwise they'll use the given name on the command line.
> 
> Also note that it's the database table name part that's singular or plural, not the whole word. So it's `PostsCell`, not `PostCells`.
> 
> You don't have to follow this convention once you start creating your own parts but we recommend doing so. The Ruby on Rails community has come to love this nomenclature even though many people complained about it when first exposed to it.

### Creating a Homepage

We can start replacing these pages one by one as we get designs, or maybe move them to the admin section of our site and build our own display pages from scratch. The public facing site won't let viewers create, edit or delete posts. What _can_ they do?

1. View a list of posts (without links to edit/delete)
2. View a single post

Since we'll probably want a way to create and edit posts going forward let's keep the scaffolded pages as they are and create new ones for these two items.

We already have `HomePage` so we won't need to create that. We want to display a list of posts to the user so we'll need to add that logic. We need to get the content from the database and we don't want the user to just see a blank screen in the meantime (depending on network conditions, server location, etc), so we'll want to show some kind of loading message or animation. And if there's an error retrieving the data we should handle that as well. And what about when we open source this blog engine and someone puts it live without any content in the database? It'd be nice if there was some kind of blank slate message.

Oh boy, our first page with data and we already have to worry about loading states, errors, and blank slates...or do we?
