Welcome to Redwood! If you haven't yet, check out the [Redwood README](https://github.com/redwoodjs/redwood/blob/main/README.md) to get a little background on why we created Redwood and the problems it's meant to solve. Redwood brings several existing technologies together for the first time into what we think is the future of database-backed single page applications.

In this tutorial we're going to build a blog engine. In reality a blog is probably not the ideal candidate for a Redwood app: blog articles can be stored in a CMS and statically generated to HTML files and served as flat files from a CDN. But as most developers are familiar with a blog and it uses all of the features we want to demonstrate, we decided to build one anyway.
